> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project is under active development and may have bugs. Inspired by PopClip, Iâ€™m building an open-source alternative with plans to fully support its plugin system (currently limited). As this is my first Swift project, the code will evolve as I learn and improve. Feedback is welcome!
